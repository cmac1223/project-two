Project two is an MEN-STACK (MongoDB, ExpressJS, and Node.js)  app with two models using CRUD on each model.  I created an app that will allow the user to briefly input vegetarian/vegans restaurant information. The app was primarily styled with Bootstrap and css. The purpose of this app is the individual who either practices a vegetarian/vegan diet or is on the fence like myself who will love to log nearby restaurants in the confidence of an app.

I wasn't able to add authentication nor a client-side API that will provide the user with more of a convenience when using the app such as google maps or recipes.  I will continue to work on these add-ons.
